# HacktoberFest-2022


## Instructions

- Add a new issue for any Leetcode Problem or Codechef problem that you want to solve in a language of your choice
- Wait for the issue to be assigned to you
- Once the issue is assigned, fork the repo and start working on it
- If the problem is already solved in any other language than the one you have chosen, there would be an existing folder with the id and the name of the problem.
- Add your solution inside that problem folder
- If the folder is not created, then create the folder with the id and name as explained in the folder structure block below
- Raise a PR once you think you are ready
- Make sure to mention the issue id/issue link in the PR Comment for enabling faster review of your commit
- Wait for your PR to get reviewed
- Once the PR is merged spread the word and keep contributing until your Hacktoberfest quota of PR's are done
